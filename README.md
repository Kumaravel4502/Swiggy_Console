🚀 Just Built a Swiggy Console App in Java! ☕🍛

Excited to share my latest Java project: a console-based Swiggy food ordering simulation!
This app lets users:

Select from 5 popular Chennai hotels
Browse and order from dynamic menus
Calculate GST and total bill
Choose payment methods (Cash, UPI, Card, Net Banking)
Experience OTP-based online payment simulation
This project helped me practice:

Java control structures & loops
User input validation
Modular switch-case logic
Simulating real-world payment flows
